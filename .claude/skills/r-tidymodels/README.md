# R Tidymodels Skill

Transform Claude Code into an expert R data scientist specializing in machine learning with the tidymodels ecosystem.

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive expertise in building, tuning, and deploying machine learning models in R using the tidymodels framework. It covers the complete ML workflow from data preparation through model deployment, following best practices from the official tidymodels documentation and the "Tidy Modeling with R" book.

## When This Skill Activates

Claude will automatically use this skill when you:

- Work with tidymodels packages (recipes, parsnip, tune, workflows)
- Mention **machine learning in R**, predictive modeling, or model development
- Discuss **feature engineering**, preprocessing, or data transformation
- Talk about **model tuning**, hyperparameters, or cross-validation
- Ask about model evaluation, comparison, or deployment
- Use tidymodels-related keywords: SMOTE, recipe steps, parsnip models, etc.

## What This Skill Provides

### 1. Complete ML Workflows

Three-phase approach based on "Tidy Modeling with R":

- **Phase 1: Foundation** - Data splitting, recipes, model specification, basic evaluation
- **Phase 2: Optimization** - Resampling, hyperparameter tuning, model comparison
- **Phase 3: Production** - Ensembles, interpretability, deployment, monitoring

### 2. Expert Recipe Knowledge

Comprehensive preprocessing with 100+ recipe steps:
- Missing data handling (imputation strategies)
- Feature engineering (interactions, polynomials, splines)
- Categorical encoding (dummy variables, target encoding)
- Transformations (log, Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson)
- Normalization and scaling
- Feature selection and filtering
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, ICA)
- Class imbalance (SMOTE, upsampling, downsampling)
- Text processing (tokenization, TF-IDF)
- Date/time features

See [Recipe Steps Guide](references/recipe-steps-guide.md) for the complete catalog.

### 3. Model Specification

Unified interface to 50+ model types through parsnip:
- Linear/logistic regression (with regularization)
- Decision trees and random forests
- Gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Support vector machines
- Neural networks
- Naive Bayes, K-NN, and more

### 4. Tuning Strategies

Multiple hyperparameter optimization approaches:
- **Grid search**: Regular grids, random search, space-filling designs
- **Bayesian optimization**: Efficient for expensive models
- **Simulated annealing**: Global optimization
- **Racing methods**: Early stopping for efficiency

### 5. Production-Ready Patterns

- Model ensembling and stacking
- Variable importance and interpretability
- Probability calibration
- Threshold optimization
- Deployment pipelines with vetiver
- Model monitoring and retraining

## Quick Start

### Example 1: Simple Classification

```r
library(tidymodels)

# Split data
set.seed(123)
split <- initial_split(iris, prop = 0.75, strata = Species)

# Create recipe
rec <- recipe(Species ~ ., data = training(split)) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())

# Specify model
rf_spec <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), min_n = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("ranger") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

# Bundle in workflow
wflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  add_model(rf_spec)

# Tune
folds <- vfold_cv(training(split), v = 10)
results <- wflow %>% tune_grid(resamples = folds, grid = 15)

# Finalize and evaluate
best <- select_best(results, metric = "roc_auc")
final_wflow <- finalize_workflow(wflow, best)
final_fit <- last_fit(final_wflow, split)

collect_metrics(final_fit)
```

### Example 2: Regression with Feature Engineering

```r
library(tidymodels)

# Create advanced recipe
rec <- recipe(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_train) %>%
  step_mutate(House_Age = Year_Sold - Year_Built) %>%
  step_log(Sale_Price, Lot_Area, base = 10) %>%
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())

# Compare multiple models
wf_set <- workflow_set(
  preproc = list(full = rec),
  models = list(
    rf = rand_forest_spec,
    xgb = xgboost_spec,
    glmnet = elastic_net_spec
  )
)

# Tune all at once
results <- wf_set %>%
  workflow_map(fn = "tune_grid", resamples = folds, grid = 20)

# Rank by performance
rank_results(results, rank_metric = "rmse")
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Data Budgeting First
Split data BEFORE any analysis to prevent leakage:
```r
set.seed(123)
split <- initial_split(data, prop = 0.80, strata = outcome)
train <- training(split)
test <- testing(split)
```

### 2. Honest Estimation
Include ALL preprocessing in validation:
```r
# ✅ Correct - preprocessing in recipe
recipe(outcome ~ .) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())

# ❌ Wrong - preprocessing outside validation
data_normalized <- data %>% mutate(across(where(is.numeric), scale))
```

### 3. Composable Workflows
Bundle recipe + model for consistency:
```r
workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(my_recipe) %>%
  add_model(my_model)
```

### 4. Systematic Comparison
Compare models on same resampling:
```r
workflow_set(
  preproc = list(basic = recipe1, advanced = recipe2),
  models = list(rf = rf_spec, xgb = xgb_spec)
) %>%
  workflow_map(fn = "tune_grid", resamples = folds)
```

### 5. Appropriate Metrics
Choose metrics matching your problem:
- **Regression**: RMSE, R-squared, MAE
- **Balanced classification**: Accuracy, ROC-AUC
- **Imbalanced classification**: PR-AUC, F1, Sensitivity

## Common Workflows

### Regression
1. Split with stratification
2. Recipe: impute → engineer features → log transform → dummy → normalize
3. Models: elastic net, random forest, XGBoost
4. Tune with grid search or Bayesian optimization
5. Evaluate with RMSE, R-squared, MAE
6. Interpret with variable importance
7. Deploy with confidence intervals

### Classification
1. Split with stratification
2. Recipe: impute → engineer features → balance classes → dummy → normalize
3. Models: logistic, random forest, XGBoost
4. Tune optimizing ROC-AUC or PR-AUC
5. Evaluate with confusion matrix, ROC curves
6. Optimize probability threshold
7. Deploy with calibrated probabilities

### Time Series
1. Time-based split (no shuffling!)
2. Recipe: create lags → rolling stats → cyclical features
3. Rolling origin resampling
4. Models: prophet, random forest, XGBoost
5. Walk-forward validation
6. Deploy with monitoring

## Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Split data first, always with `strata` for classification
- Use workflows to bundle recipe + model
- Apply `step_novel()` before `step_dummy()`
- Remove zero-variance predictors with `step_zv()` after dummies
- Normalize after creating dummy variables
- Use multiple metrics for comprehensive evaluation
- Visualize tuning results with `autoplot()`
- Evaluate on held-out test set with `last_fit()`

❌ **DON'T:**
- Preprocess data before splitting (data leakage!)
- Tune on test set
- Forget to set seed before splitting
- Normalize before creating dummy variables
- Skip `step_novel()` when using `step_dummy()`
- Evaluate only on training data
- Trust all predictions equally (check applicability)
